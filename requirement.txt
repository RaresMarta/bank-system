Bank ATMs Management service

- manage all ATMs & accounts for the bank

- allow users to create an account to the bank using their personal details (name, job, email & address)
- retrieving or depositing money into their account

Each user can deposit an unlimited amount of money, but only retrieve 5.000$ per day; you’ll also have to check that they aren’t retrieving more money than it’s available in their account

[optional] Write unit tests to cover all the scenarios for the software
