# Bank ATMs Management service

You are in charge of creating the software for a bank. Your program needs to manage all ATMs & accounts for the bank.

Write a Ruby program which will allow users to create an account to the bank using their personal details (name, job, email & address) & retrieving or depositing money into their account.

Each user can deposit an unlimited amount of money, but only retrieve 5.000$ per day; you’ll also have to check that they aren’t retrieving more money than it’s available in their account.

*(optional)* Write unit tests to cover all the scenarios for the software.
